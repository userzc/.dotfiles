* Getting Started

  This is the first attempt to create a repository for =dotfiles= and an
  install script to make all the necesary changes.

  To clone this repository, from prompt use:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git clone https://github.com/userzc/.dotfiles.git
    cd .dotfiles
    git submodule sync
    git submodule update --init --recursive
  #+END_SRC

** Instalation

   To install the files in this repository use:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     dotfiles_sync -i
   #+END_SRC

   On Windows the script must be run as administrator.

** Quick basic environment

   To install some usefull features, such emacs and other goodies as
   soon as possible, use the =basic_environ.sh= script with curl:

   #+begin_src sh
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/userzc/.dotfiles/raw/master/basic_environ.sh)"
   #+end_src

   or wget:

   #+begin_src sh
     sh -c "$(wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/userzc/.dotfiles/raw/master/basic_environ.sh -O -)"
   #+end_src


*** Note:

    Currently this only works on *Ubuntu 16.04* later on compatibility
    with other distributions may be added as I use them.

    To use it in *debian 8*, the package =sudo= must be added and
    configured:

    #+begin_src sh
      # as root
      aptitude install sudo
      adduser $USER sudo
    #+end_src

*** Note on Ubuntu

    *pip* was globally installed as in the instructions in it's [[https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip][Documentation]],
    and used to install *virtualenv* and *virtualenvwrapper* globally.

    If using [[http://i3wm.org/][i3wm]] (as this configuration assumes), it may seem a good
    idea to [[http://askubuntu.com/questions/108925/how-to-tell-chrome-what-to-do-with-a-magnet-link][change xdg-open]] to open magnet and torrent files from the
    web browser.

*** Note on Windows

    It is recommended that most windows packages are installed through
    [[http://chocolatey.org][chocolatey]] since this facilitates the process, in particular
    install packages.

    So far the installation of *maven* facilitates the use of *malabar*
    mode in Windows, however work still needs to be done to
    get *eclimd* working properly.

*** Note on Java related software

    Most java software on ubuntu was installed manually:

    - eclipse was installed using the turorial [[http://akovid.blogspot.mx/2012/08/installing-eclipse-juno-42-in-ubuntu.html][installing eclipse on Ubuntu]].
    - eclim was installed following the [[http://eclim.org/install.html][installation instructions]] from
      the official webpage.
    - groovy was also installed using the [[http://gvmtool.net/][installation instructions]]
      from the official webpage.

** Features

   So far install script =dotfiles_sync= is able to =symlink= files
   and folders under some specific lists and special cases (=.config/=
   folder).

   This script accepts options for install (=-i=, =--install=), listing
   the posible files to modify (=-l=, =--list=) and for removal of the
   existing links or files (=-r=, =--remove=). The script is installing
   files through python, so it should also be portable to windows.
